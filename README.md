# MegaSSR
Here we introduce MegaSSR, a new online resource and its local standalone version that enables the identification of Simple Sequence Repeats (SSR) and the design of SSR markers in high-throughput data scale. MegaSSR perfectly matches any target genome (including Plantae, Protozoa, Animalia, Chromista, Fungi, Archaea, and Bacteria).
